            Iguazu falls is a beautiful waterfall that consists of two steps formed by basalt. Each step is about 35-40 meters in height. The name comes from the Guarani words: "y" meaning water, and "ûasú" meaning big. It is located in between Argentina and Brazil, 95% of the river is in Brazil, and 80% of the falls are in Argentina.
